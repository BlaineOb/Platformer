# Platformer
Platformer game currently in it's early stages. Written in Python using the arcade library. All artwork used is from http://kenney.nl.

I've finished most of the fundamentals, and am now focusing on how to properly design levels. There are lots of big things still to implement, such as:

-Enemies
-Moving Platforms
-Player Health
-Collectibles(coins or gems)
-Animations
