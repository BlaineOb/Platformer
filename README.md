# Platformer
Platformer game in progress. Written in Python using the arcade library. All artwork used is from http://kenney.nl or https://itch.io/game-assets/free

Development continues. It's increasingly difficult to keep my expectations in check as I tend to think of lots of crazy ideas but have no real way to implement most of them. Maybe one day...

As for now, I'm trying to add more features to game to make the levels longer and more distinct. I'm also trying to add combat of some sort into the game, so that boss battles can be implemented.
